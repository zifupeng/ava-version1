# Template for JSDoc API Documentation

This directory contains a template for generating JSDoc API docs
for the Node.js Client API with
[gulp-jsdoc3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-jsdoc3).
The template is based on the "cerulean" Bootswatch theme as generated
by [DocStrap](https://github.com/docstrap/docstrap) (version
1.0.0).

(Note that API docs generated by DocStrap versions past 1.0.0 currently
throw errors when hosted on MarkLogic servers because of HTML that is
invalid XML.)

To generate the docs using this template, run the following from the
root project directory:

`gulp doc`

The docs are generated into a doc/ subdirectory. You can change this
destination as well as other settings by editing this project's
jsdoc.json file.

The original DocStrap template was modified in the following ways:

- Removed embedded javascript from layout.tmpl so the pages can safely
be hosted by MarkLogic Server as XHTML. The embedded JavaScript has
been moved to the static/scripts/extracted/ subdirectory and is
referenced from there.
- Edited CSS to make minor color adjustments and apply Bootstrap styles
to dropdown menus.

You can use an alternative templates and themes by editing the
jsdoc.json file in the root project directory. Change the "template"
and "theme" values.
